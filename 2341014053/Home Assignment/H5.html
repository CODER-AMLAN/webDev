<!--Q5. Create a Webpage with a Photo Showcase: 
• Display three photos in a row (you can use a table for the layout). 
• Each photo should have a caption below it. 
• Include a blockquote with a famous quote for each photo, and make sure the 
author’s name is semantically emphasized using appropriate HTML tags (e.g., 
<strong> or <em>). 
• Ensure that the quotes are properly formatted to visually resemble quotes, 
rather than just plain text.-->
