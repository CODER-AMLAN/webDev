<!--Q10. Create a page titled "Linear Motion Equation": 
i.   Use the <title> tag to set the webpage's title to "Linear Motion Equation." 
ii.  Within the body of the page: 
• Create a main heading that says: "S = vᵢt + ½at²: The Equation of Linear 
Motion." Use appropriate tags to make this text bold and emphasized. 
• Below  the  heading,  insert  the  following  explanation  in  a  paragraph  and  an 
unordered list that explains each symbol: 
The  formula  S  =  vᵢt  +  ½at²  describes  the  motion  of  an  object  under  constant 
acceleration. Here: 
o S represents the displacement, 
o vᵢ is the initial velocity, 
o t is the time, 
o a is the acceleration, and 
o ½at² is the additional displacement due to acceleration. 
iii. Format the variables "S," "vᵢ," "t," "a," and "½at²" in italics using the appropriate 
HTML tags. 
iv. Add the following quote related to motion using proper quotation tags: 
"An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force." 
Highlight the phrase "external force" by underlining it. 
Insert this sentence in the above paragraph. Note: This equation was originally written 
in 1905.
